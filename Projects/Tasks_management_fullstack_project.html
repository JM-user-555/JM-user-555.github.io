            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                This full-stack web project is a modern task management application featuring user authentication, personalized dashboards, 
                and dynamic task handling. Built with a React frontend and an Express/Node.js backend connected to a MySQL database, it 
                allows users to sign up, log in securely, and manage their own to-do lists. Each user has a dedicated profile page where 
                they can add and remove tasks, with all data operations performed in real time and persisted in the database. The application 
                also includes a responsive, visually appealing UI with light/dark theme support, demonstrating both frontend and backend 
                integration, RESTful API design, state management, and secure user data handling.

            <p>This project is highly valuable for my portfolio as it showcases my ability to build a complete, production-style web 
                application from scratch. It demonstrates proficiency in React, Node.js, Express, MySQL, REST APIs, authentication, and 
                modern UI/UX practices. Such a project highlights my skills in both frontend and backend development, database design, 
                and user experience, making me stand out in software development.
