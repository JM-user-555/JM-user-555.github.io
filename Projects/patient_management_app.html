            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                I was asked by a physiotherapist to implement a patient management system application that manages patient related data, including adding, deleting, updating and retrieving a patient information.
                Moreover, it tackles features like adding and editing session notes.
                <br>
                In this project, the therapist can add a patient, view patient details, update patient details, delete a patient, add a session note and view session notes. 
                The frontend application is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Data are handled as JSON format using local storage.
            </p>
            <p>Key features
                <ul>
                    <li>Patient Management: Add, view and edit patient details such as name, age, gender, phone number and notes.</li>
                    <li>Session Management: Add new sessions for patients including details such as date, SOAP notes and payment status.</li>
                    <li>Form Handling: handling forms for adding new patients and sessions with validation of fields.</li>
                    <li>Dynamic Content Update: Dynamically update the DOM to reflect changes in patient and session details.</li>
                    <li>Data persistence: Save patient data to file, JSON file.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This project showcases advanced problem-solving skills in building frontend web applications using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It highlights expertise in handling javascript objects applying the CRUD operations, which include create, read, update and delete objects.</p>
