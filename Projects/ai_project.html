            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                In this file, we are going to build an AI agent that solves the sudoku using csp and backtracking.
                <br>
                Main Rule:
Each row, column and block (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers from 1 to 9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square.

The solution should be returned based on the rule indicated above, no matter whether the sudoku is in easy or medium or hard mode.
            </p>
            <p>Key features
                <ul>
                    <li>CSP-Based Optimization: Utilizes constraint satisfaction to eliminate invalid number choices early in the solving process, improving efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Backtracking Algorithm: A systematic search method that ensures the solution adheres to Sudoku rules.</li>
                    <li>Adaptive to Difficulty Levels: Capable of solving Sudoku puzzles of any difficulty</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This project showcases advanced problem-solving skills in AI and algorithm design. It highlights expertise in applying AI techniques such as CSP and backtracking to real-world problems, demonstrating proficiency in optimizing complex systems. </p>
