            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to implement a student information system application (SIS) that manages student related data, including adding, deleting, updating and retrieving a student information.
                Moreover, it tackles features like course enrollment and GPA/grades management.
                <br>
                In this project we will have both administrator and students access where an administrator can add a new student or a course, search for a student and update his record, removing and dropping course for student, adding new teacher.Teacher can view students
                in the course and set student grades. Whereas the student can view his GPA grades and personal average (Restricted to reading only).</p>
            <p>Key features
                <ul>
                    <li>Object oriented programming: classes are used for administrator,teacher and student with public and private attributes, and methods will be used for handling the functionalities for each.</li>
                    <li>Arrays of object and pointers: Set of objects are handled using array of objects such as array of students and courses.</li>
                    <li>Structures: a course structure will include details such as code, name, and credits.</li>
                    <li>File handling: sequential and binary files are used to save and get student/course records and teachers data.</li>
                    <li>Inheritance: student, teacher and administrator classes inherit attributes such as id and password from a user class (parent class).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This project showcases advanced problem-solving skills in building applications in C++. It highlights expertise in applying advanced features such as classes, writing and reading from text files and binary files and friendly functions. </p>
