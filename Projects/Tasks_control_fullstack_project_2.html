            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                This full-stack web project is a Task Management System designed for organizations to efficiently assign, track, 
                and manage tasks between managers and employees. Built with a modern React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend connected 
                to a relational database, the application supports user authentication, role-based access (manager vs. employee), 
                task assignment with due dates, real-time notifications, and a clean, responsive user interface. Managers can assign tasks 
                to employees, monitor progress, and receive notifications when tasks are completed, while employees can view, complete, and 
                manage their assigned tasks.
