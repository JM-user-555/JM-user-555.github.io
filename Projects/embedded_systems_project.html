            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                For my final project in the Embedded Systems Lab course, I designed and built a small robot controlled via Arduino to participate in a football contest for robots. 
                The robot was programmed to autonomously navigate the playing field, track and approach the ball, and attempt to score goals.
                Key components of the project included motor control, sensor integration, and real-time decision-making algorithms, all powered by an Arduino microcontroller.
                This project showcases my hands-on experience in robotics and embedded systems, highlighting skills in microcontroller programming,
