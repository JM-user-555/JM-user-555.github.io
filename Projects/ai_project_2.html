            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                In this file, we are going to build an AI agent that plays TicTacToe and takes the appropriate decisions of actions based on 
                the output of Minimax Algorithm.
                <br>
                This AI project centers on building a TicTacToe agent that utilizes the Minimax algorithm, a classic decision-making
                process in game theory, to play against human players. The Minimax algorithm empowers the agent to make strategic 
                decisions by analyzing possible moves, selecting actions that maximize its advantage while minimizing the potential 
                for the opponent's success. This approach ensures that the AI agent plays optimally, considering all possible outcomes 
                to either win or prevent a loss.
                <br>
                Main Rule:
                A player wins if 3 states (X or O) were aligned vertically or horizentally or diagonally.
                The user plays "X", in which he tries to maximise his score to win. And the agent plays "O" to minimize the score and
                preventing the user from winning. A tie game is achieved when there are no possible moves and none of the players wins,
                in which the score is 0.
                
            </p>
            <p>Key features
                <ul>
                    <li>Optimal Decision-Making: Utilizes the Minimax algorithm to analyze all possible moves and outcomes, ensuring the AI plays strategically and optimally, actively countering to either win or force a draw..</li>
                    <li>Robust Game Logic: Considers each game scenario, demonstrating strong adversarial problem-solving, a foundational skill in AI game development.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Including this project in a portfolio highlights proficiency in AI concepts and algorithms, particularly the Minimax algorithm, which is a foundational strategy in AI game development and adversarial problem-solving. It showcases skills in both AI development and the application of decision-making strategies that are applicable to larger, more complex games and problem-solving contexts.
