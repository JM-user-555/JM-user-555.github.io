            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                This project is a web-based chatbot application called CampusBot, designed to assist university students and visitors by 
                answering questions related to academic, financial, and campus life topics. Built using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the 
                chatbot leverages string matching to understand user queries and provide relevant responses from a curated FAQ or frequently 
                asked questions. The user interface features a modern, responsive design with real-time chat functionality, making it easy for 
                users to interact and receive instant support about university information, admission processes, faculty details, and more. 
                This project demonstrates skills in web development, natural language processing, and user experience design.
