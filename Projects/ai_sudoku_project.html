            <h2>Project Description AI Sudoku Solver</h2>
            <p>This AI project involved programming an agent that solves Sudoku puzzles using search algorithms. The agent was designed to analyze the Sudoku grid, apply logical strategies, and efficiently solve the puzzle.</p>
            <p>Key features
                <ul>
                    <li>CSP-Based Optimization: Utilizes constraint satisfaction to eliminate invalid number choices early in the solving process, improving efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Backtracking Algorithm: A systematic search method that ensures the solution adheres to Sudoku rules.</li>
                    <li>Adaptive to Difficulty Levels: Capable of solving Sudoku puzzles of any difficulty</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This project showcases advanced problem-solving skills in AI and algorithm design. It highlights expertise in applying AI techniques such as CSP and backtracking to real-world problems, demonstrating proficiency in optimizing complex systems. </p>
